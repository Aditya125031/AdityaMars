MY LEARNING EXPERIENCE
  It was kind of fun to solve these problems but also kind of hectic as it's a busy time and its hard to manage everything for me.
  I had to revisit all the Linux commands and basics which I learnt in sem 1.
  I wasnt able to solve all of them as some of them are confusing to even understand.

WHAT DID I LEARN
  I learnt how to operate GITHUB, making a repositoty, pushing files,etc.
  I learnt linux commands again.
  I learnt how to solve Morse code.
  I learnt about the 4 number system 'QUATERNION' and how to get it from euler'S system.
  I learnt about behavior tree and it's benefits and uses compared to other codnitional operations.


CHALLENGES FACED
  I had to find a Linux software online or use my friends laptop with a linux in it as i can't on my own for somme reasons.
  The first medium dose task was confusing as i wasn't able to understand it until the last.
  THe second medium dose was just Morse, so istudied about morse code and hoe do we convert it to English, writing the code logic took me some time and it took me the longest to complete due to constant errors.
  The third medium dose was a rather simple one after figuring out the pattern, however my code logic won't give an alphabet if 'A' is entered, so i don't know about that.
  The Sanchiko MUchiko problem were rather long too, writing 3 filters and a variance function took  me some sweet time, the problem i faced was selection of the 3 elements for taking out average and median as my code give 'n-2' result if 'n' noise data are entered, but nonetheless it works.
  The 'GIMBAl LOCK' was a rather interesting question as it sparked my interest, i read about the Gimbal Lock first rather than solving the problem.
  i had to search conversions from Euler's to Quaternion, which were a bit confusing but had a pattern. I fixed them in a fucntion an solved it.
  HARD DOSE
  I was only able to solve 1 hard dose by myself.
  The first harddose was very confusing as the text file for the obstancle placement made me question the  values. QUESTION- If the obstacle placing goes 5 1 0 2 in nort west sowth and east respectively, wont it be placed outside the field.
  The second harddose was a similar on, i didnt have much time to study about pinhole camerea's so i was unable to solve it.
  Thwe third harddose was rather simple, learning about behavior trees, sequence and fallback nodes. There's a posssibility I might have interpreted the question wrong making it easy.

MY APPROACH
  My approach was to understand the question as well as i can, ask for some different point of views, make a fucntion algorithm to see the path and atlast write the program and debug it.

MAZEROVER LEARNINGS
  I don't think i learnt anything significant
  I learnt how  to work with VM's and how to some surface information of gazebo
